### Backend (Already Set Up)
- Edge Function `draft-report` - Analyzes with Gemini AI

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Cloudinary not configured" | Check .env file, restart dev server |
| "Missing Supabase" | Verify VITE_SUPABASE_URL and key in .env |
| Photo won't upload | Check Cloudinary credentials, network connection |
| AI returns error | Ensure backend function is deployed, GEMINI_API_KEY is set |
| No report in database | Verify Supabase migrations were run, RLS allows inserts |
